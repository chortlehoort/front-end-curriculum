## Google Chrome Dev Tools

The developer tools available in Chrome allow you modify your code, see errors, watch network traffic, find performance problems, and view detailed information about the documents that you are viewing.

### Writing JavaScript in the console

Show students some basic examples of how they can write JavaScript in the console and have it immediately executed by the browser.

 + `alert()`
 + `document.querySelector()`
 + `innerHTML()`

### Inspecting and modifying HTML

Show students how to inspect specific elements on a page, add attributes, and even delete them.

### Inspecting and modifying CSS

Show students how they can tweak the design of their webpages right in the browser, which they can then copy pasta back into their code.

### Network traffic

 + Show document list
 + Show request/response headers per request
 + Filtering requests by type
 + Large/small row types
 + Timeline overview

> **Instructor:** Break now for class exercise. Have the students load an HTML document that has several elements, and ask them to change the format, colors, and layout just by modifying the CSS in Chrome. Then have them modify the DOM in the console with some innerHTML commands, and deleting other DOM elements.

## Teamwork Tools

### Trello

Have students create a free account, and how to set up the basic *Backlog*, *To Do*, *Doing*, and *Done* columns. Walk them through how to create a ticket, and how they can move tickets from column to column.

+ Discuss how tickets should revolve around features, not pages.
+ Discuss acceptance criteria language with BDD.
+ Show them how to use labels and checklists.

### Moqups

Have students create a free account and explain how creating a wireframe that the team agrees upon before any code is written will be a great guide during a project.
