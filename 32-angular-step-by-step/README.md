# Music History in Angular

1. Now you can walk students through building a bare bones version of Music History in Angular. Clone the [angular step-by-step repo](https://github.com/nashville-software-school/angular-step-by-step/releases) and checkout the `v1.0` tag to start.
1. Keep checking out the tags up to `v6.0` to show them the progressively more complex features.

Once you're done walking them through it, assign them the task of building their Music History application in Angular.
