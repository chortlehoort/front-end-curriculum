## Commenting your code

`<!-- This is how you comment HTML code -->`

### Element Attributes
> **MDN:** "Additional values that configure the elements or adjust their behavior"

+ `<a href="...">`
+ `<div id="...">`
+ `<span class="...">`
+ `<p style="...">`
+ `<img src="...">`
+ `<input name="...">`
+ `<input type="...">`
+ `<input required>`

They can, and usually are, combined.

`<div id="bio" class="student--biography" style="color: red">`

> **Instructor Suggestion:** 
> Break now for a class exercise. Have students create a very simple blog document that contains a header, navigation (using a table for now), footer, and multiple articles that each contain their own header, footer, and multiple sections. Each article should include a related image. Make sure students comment their code to describe the purpose of each element.

### Forms & element types

Use, or fork, an example [HTML form Codepen project](http://codepen.io/chortlehoort/pen/ogpVZq) to show all the major field types that can be used.

  + form
  + select
  + option
  + textarea
  + text
  + password
  + date
  + submit
  + radio
  + checkbox
  + button
  + range
  + number
  + tel
  + url
  + email

> **Instructor Suggestion:** 
> Break now for a class exercise. Have students create an example bank loan form based on the instructions in this [HTML101 Codepen project](http://codepen.io/chortlehoort/pen/XbEqLW).

## Homework

1. Complete Treehouse HTML First course.
1. Complete Treehouse Creating HTML content course.

## Block elements vs inline elements  

Just touch on this by showing how some elements fill the width of their parent and some don't. Planting the seed for later when we begin styling.

A [block element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Block-level_elements) is an element that has, but may not be limited to, the following characteristics:

+ If no width is set, will expand naturally to fill its parent container
+ Can have margins and/or padding
+ If no height is set, will expand naturally to fit its child elements (assuming they are not floated or positioned)
+ By default, will be placed below previous elements in the markup (assuming no floats or positioning on surrounding elements)
+ Ignores the vertical-align property

An [inline element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Inline_elemente) has, but may not be limited to, the following characteristics:

+ Flows along with text content
+ Will not clear previous content to drop to the next line like block elements
+ Is subject to white-space settings in CSS
+ Will ignore top and bottom margin settings, but will apply left and right margins, and any padding
+ Will ignore the width and height properties
+ If floated left or right, will automatically become a block-level element, subject to all block characteristics
+ Is subject to the vertical-align property

The easiest way to picture an inline element is to think of it as a box that acts like text. What happens, for example, to text thatâ€™s not separated by other elements? It flows one letter after the other. If you put an inline element next to text, it will flow next to that text just like another piece of text.

> **Instructor Suggestion:** 
> Break now for a class exercise. Live-code some example where a span or anchor tag is a child of a block element, and then show a block element child.

## The Document Object Model (DOM)

The Document Object Model is a platform- and language-neutral interface that will allow programs and scripts to dynamically access and update the content, structure and style of documents. The document can be further processed and the results of that processing can be incorporated back into the presented page. This is an overview of DOM-related materials here at W3C and around the web.

The HTML you write is parsed by the browser and turned into the DOM. But your HTML is not the DOM. Mistakes/omissions can be 'fixed' by the browser, such as when you add a `<table>` element in your HTML and leave out the required `<tbody>` element. The browser will just insert that `<tbody>` for you. The Javscript you write can also really change what's rendered far beyond the original markup.

# Challenge \#1

Create a form that has a range input, and a number input, both with the same values for min, max, and default. When the user changes the value on the range input, the value of the number input should match. The opposite should be true. The values of the two inputs should always be synchronized.
