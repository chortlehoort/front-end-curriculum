## Chocolatey package manager (*optional*)

Windows, like OSX, does not have a built in package manager (a fancy term for a piece of software that lets you easily install other software that you need as a developer). There will be times, many weeks into class, as you gain confidence and skill, that you will want to use a package manager. Therefore, if you feel up to the task - meaning, you were able to install all the required software easily - you may want to install Chocolately.

Here's the [official page](https://chocolatey.org/), but it's instructions are written to an audience of existing software developers and may be confusing for a layperson. Here's the basic instructions.

1. Press your Windows key.
1. Type `cmd` into the search box.
1. You'll see a black box as the first search result named `cmd`.
1. Right click that icon and select the "Run as administrator" option. This opens up the _**Windows Command Line**_.
1. When that starts, copy the following command with Ctrl+C, and once that's done paste it into the command line by right-clicking anywhere in that window.
  `@powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Command "iex ((new-object net.webclient).DownloadString('https://chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))" && SET PATH=%PATH%;%ALLUSERSPROFILE%\chocolatey\bin`
