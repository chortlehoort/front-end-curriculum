# Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to be the guide for instructors of the front end curriculum at Nashville Software School. All resources, exercises, projects, challenges and quizzes have been moved to the [milestones repository](https://github.com/nashville-software-school/front-end-milestones).

## Student Feedback Guidelines

Feedback needs to be timely and direct. Here's some guidelines to give to your junior instructors/teaching assistants. When a student submits a quiz, please make sure that your team provides feedback within 24 hours.

1. **Feedback must be specific and clear.** Avoid phrases like "You need to improve your variable naming," or "make sure you modularize your code". Point out specific lines of code that need improvement and give clear instructions. For example, "This variable should be named appropriately. It stores the user's name so name it `userName`."
2. **Focus on the solution of the problem rather than the student.** For example, don't say, "I see that you are having challenges solving this problem. Have you been doing the exercises?" Instead, focus on the code. "Student, the code you wrote for function `x` doesn't fulfill the criteria. Please review the requirements and if you need advice on implementation, come and speak to me."
3. **Provide direct explanations of code that lacks comprehension, and clear instructions on how to improve.**
